This visualizer utilizes the Porter Stemmer backend that I did as part of my other weekend project. For an framework as buggy as JavaFX, I wanted to provide something to the community 
so that people would have an easier time working with JavaFX applications.
NOTE : The source is yet to be refactored. And I will be incrementally working on refactoring this so that you guys would have an easier time reusing the code. 

**How to run***
Launch com.example.porterstemmergui.HelloApplication.java  (preferably in IntelliJ)
